  `dist/index.js` is a special file in Actions.
  When you reference an action with `uses:` in a workflow, `index.js` is the code that will run.
  For our project, we generate this file through a build process from other source files.
  We need to make sure the checked-in `index.js` actually matches what we expect it to be.
  **NOTE**: this action requires that the to-be-tested action has two scripts
  defined in it's `package.json`: `compile` and `package`
inputs:
